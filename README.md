# Entertainment Virginia Database Development
1. The purpose of the project is to help Entertainment Virginia create a database management information system better to manage the companyâ€™s large amount of data.
2. To accommodate this high demand for performances, Entertainment Virginia decided to create a database to store, retrieve, analyze, and manage their data on plays, performers, directors, and sponsors.
